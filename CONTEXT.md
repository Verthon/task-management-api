Primary Goal: Learn backend as frontend developer
Approach: Simple tasks management api with following rules:
* Koa as minimal Node.js framework
* focus on testability using TDD with Mocha and Chai (focus on blazing fast tests)
* business-first focus with DDD principles
* Modern lightweight approach for Node.js with Node 20 ESM and Typescript
* Functional approach - classes are only used to extend Error JS class - favor for composition and thisless classes
* DB for simplicity SQLite however each repository has in-memory strategy to speed up tests
* ORM Knex - hidden as much as possible (with time constraints) behind facade
* Zod for validation - as much as possible (with time constraints) behind facade
